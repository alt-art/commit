See [wiki page](https://github.com/alt-art/commit/wiki) for usage and configuration.

See [Installation guide](INSTALL.md) for installation.

This command-line interface makes it possible to make patterned (conventional) commit messages to organize your repository.

This project is a clone of [cz-cli](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) with some minor changes.

I made this project for my own use, because I don't want to mess with the original cz-cli.

## Principal changes in this project

- Don't need to make your project commitizen friendly
- Can be used with any project and any language
- Custom conventional commit message style can be used without any other packages
- Plug and play just needs git installed
